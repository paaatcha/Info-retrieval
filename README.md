# Information retrieval repository
This repository contains my own implementations related to the UFES' discipline modern information retrieval. Most of the codes were done in python. However, some assignments I needed to use the aLine, a library developed by UFES' students. Unfortunately, this lib is not open and I can't put it here.

Most codes are commented and the guidelines can be found in the [professor's website](https://www.inf.ufes.br/~elias/).

**Python dependences:**
* Python 2.7.x
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* python-docx
* NLTK
* python-json
* docx
* bs4
