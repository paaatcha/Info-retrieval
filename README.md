# Information retrieval repository
This repository contains my own implementations related to the UFES' discipline modern information retrieval. Most of the codes were done in python. However, some assignments I needed to use the aLine, which is a library developed by UFES' students.

**Python dependences:**
* Python 2.7.x
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas


All assignments are divided into folders as follows:
* Assignment 1
