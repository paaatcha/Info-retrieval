# Information retrieval repository
This repository contains my own implementations related to the UFES' discipline modern information retrieval. Most of the codes were done in python. However, some assignments I needed to use the aLine, a library developed by UFES' students. Unfortunately, this lib is not open and I can't put it here.

**Python dependences:**
* Python 2.7.x
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* python-docx
* NLTK
* python-json


All assignments are divided into folders as follows:
* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/paaatcha/info-retrieval/tree/master/assingment-1)
* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/paaatcha/info-retrieval/tree/master/assingment-2)
* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/paaatcha/info-retrieval/tree/master/assingment-3)
* [Assignment 4](https://github.com/paaatcha/info-retrieval/tree/master/assingment-4)
* [Assignment 5](https://github.com/paaatcha/info-retrieval/tree/master/assingment-5)
* [Assignment 6](https://github.com/paaatcha/info-retrieval/tree/master/assingment-6)
